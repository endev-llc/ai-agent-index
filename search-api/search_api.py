"""
Decentralized Search API using The Graph + TF-IDF ranking

Flow:
  1. User makes a GET request to /search?q=searchTerm.
  2. The API queries your subgraph for agents whose 'isActive' is true
     in batches (max 1000 per query). (Currently, the searchTerm is not used in the subgraph query.)
  3. All fetched agents are then ranked off-chain via TF-IDF, incorporating
     name, description, socialLink, profileUrl, address, adminAddress (with different importances).
  4. The top 10 ranked agents are returned as JSON.

Configuration:
  - SUBGRAPH_URL: Set this environment variable to your subgraph GraphQL endpoint.
    e.g., "https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/xxxx/ai-agent-index/version/latest"
